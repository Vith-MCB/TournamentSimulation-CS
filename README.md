# TournamentSimulation-CS
This GitHub repository contains a C# program that simulates the board for Brasiler√£o, which is the top tier football league in Brazil. The program allows users to simulate the results of the league matches and displays the updated league table, including points, goals scored, and goal difference for each team.

The program is designed to be user-friendly and customizable. Users can input the team names, club strength, system to tailor the simulation to their preferences. The program uses algorithms to calculate the results of each match based on the teams' current form, making the simulation a bit realistic.

The code is well-commented and structured in a way that is easy to understand and modify, making it a great starting point for anyone interested in sports simulations or algorithmic calculations in C#.
